# Session Cookie

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/authentication-strategies-and-implementation/managed-sessions/improving-login-and-signup-flows-with-session-management" />

👨‍💼 Let's start in the <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> where we
can update the exported `userIdKey` to `sessionKey`, and then you can go to
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/login.tsx" /> and
the <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" /> routes to fix those.

Aside from the normal refactoring variable names, we also now have the ability
to use the session's expiration time instead of calculating that at the time
we commit the cookie. Enjoy!
